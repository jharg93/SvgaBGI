This is the latest version of my SuperVGA TrueColor BGI driver.  All functions
have been implemented, but there may still be bugs.  This driver will only
work on a 386 or higher.

Note:  Palette functions, and the mouse cursor will not work with this driver.
The mouse cursor will work if you have the HGXMOUSE TSR loaded.

  Using the HiColor driver:

	Implementing the TrueColor color driver involved several hacks, as
	the BGI interface only supports 8-bit color values, but the driver
	needed support for 24-bit color values.  The procedures that needed
	to be changed were those that accepted color values, (SetColor,
	SetFillStyle, SetFillPattern, PutPixel and Floodfill)  and those 
	that return color values (GetColor and GetPixel).
	As the TrueColor modes do not support palettes, I decided to use
	the SetRgbPalette call to set colors, as it accepts values for the 
	R,G and B components of the color.

	The format of a pixel in the TrueColor modes is:
		-Byte 2- -Byte 1- -Byte 0-
		RRRRRRRR GGGGGGGG BBBBBBBB

	Several new functions are defined to make the color selection easier.
	In addition, the macro RGB(rv,gv,bv) has been defined.  It packs
	the R, G and B values into the format described above and returns the
	combined color.

	* RealDrawColor(); - Sets the current drawing color.
	  Usage:
	    setcolor(RealDrawColor(RGB(rval,gval,bval)); - HiColor modes
	    setcolor(RealDrawColor(cval)); - (suggested for any other driver)

	* RealFillColor(); - Sets the current fill color.
	  Usage:
	    setfillstyle(fillstyle,RealFillColor(RGB(rval,gval,bval)));
	    setfillstyle(fillstyle,RealFillColor(cval));
	    setfillpattern(fillpat,RealFillColor(RGB(rval,gval,bval)));
	    setfillpattern(fillpat,RealFillColor(cval));

	* RealColor(); - For putpixel, sets the color of the pixel
		       - For floodfill, sets the color of the boundary
	    putpixel(x,y,RealColor(RGB(rval,gval,bval)));
	    putpixel(x,y,RealColor(cval));
	    floodfill(x,y,RealColor(RGB(rval,gval,bval)));
	    floodfill(x,y,RealColor(cval));

	* RealDrawColor, RealFillColor, and RealColor all use a hacked 
	  interface to setrgbpalette.  If you would rather use the call
	  directly, the format is:

	    RealDrawColor:
		setrgbpalette(1024,Rval,Gval,Bval); 
	    RealFillColor:
		setrgbpalette(1025,Rval,Gval,Bval);
	    RealColor:
		setrgbpalette(1026,Rval,Gval,Bval);

	  where Rval, Gval, Bval = 0..255.

	* GetPixel normally only returns an 8-bit value.  However, the
	  value returned from the BGI driver is a 32-bit value in EDX (the 
	  BGI kernel loads the value into AX and clears the upper 8 bits),
	  so to read the value of a pixel:

	  In Pascal:
	    Color := getpixel(x,y);
	    inline($89/$56/<Color);  (* Loads 32-bit color value from EDX *)

	  In C:
	    Color = getpixel(x,y);
	    Color = _EDX;
	  
	* Paging information:

	  Mode		Paging?		# of pages (with 1024k)
	  320x200	yes		4
	  640x350	yes		1
	  640x400	yes		1
	  640x480	no		1
	  800x600	no		N/A
	  1024x768	no		N/A
	  1280x1024	no		N/A

	* Works with: ATI, Cirrus, Everex, NCR, Oak-077, Primus 2000,
	  Paradise WD90c3x and VESA [v1.2+]

	o Drivers now have compile-time support for BGI version 3.0.

	o Fixed Chips & Technologies detect bug (1.1)

	o Integrated support for HGXMOUSE mouse cursor TSR. (1.2)

	o Fixed IIT AGX bankswitch bug (1.7)

	o Started 386 code optimization (1.7)
