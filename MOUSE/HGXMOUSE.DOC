=============================================================================

  The HGXMOUSE driver provides an enhanced interface for drawing the mouse
cursor in modes the standard mouse drivers do not support.  It supports
a wide range of SuperVGA cards and provides standard mouse cursor drawing 
capabilities for 16, 256, 32k, 64k and TrueColor SuperVGA modes, 
16 and 256 color TweakedVGA modes, and tweaked and standard text modes.  
It also provides the ability to set the cursor foreground and background 
colors, and also the ability to use a bitmap for the mouse pointer.
If your Svga card supports a hardware cursor, HGXMOUSE will use it to
display the mouse cursor.

  Requirements:
	An IBM PC AT or 100% compatible. (286 or better)
	An EGA, VGA or SuperVGA video card.
	A mouse driver (mouse.com or mouse.sys equivalent)

  Features of HGXMOUSE TSR:

    ------------------------------------------
     Text mode graphical cursor driver

      * Normally, the mouse cursor in text mode is represented by a block
      character, which can only be moved in character cell increments.
      HGXMOUSE turns the block character into a graphical pointer (like
      Norton Utilities and other programs) which can be moved in pixel
      increments, but it will work with all existing applications that
      use the software mouse cursor.

      * The default shape of the text mode graphical cursor can be changed 
      with the standard mouse Set Pointer call (int 0x33, function 9).
      The maximum size of the text mode cursor is 16x16.

    ------------------------------------------
     Graphics mode cursor driver

      * The cursor shape can be changed in three ways:
	  a) Set Pointer mouse call (int 0x33, function 0x9).
	  b) Set Large Pointer call (int 0x33, function 0x12).
	     Maximum size of cursor is 32x32.
	  c) Set Bitmap Pointer call (int 0x33, function 0x4508)
	     This function allows you to use a bitmap for the mouse
	     pointer.  The maximum size of the cursor is 32x32.

      * Ability to set the cursor's foreground and background colors

=============================================================================

  Loading the HGXMOUSE TSR.

    The HGXMOUSE TSR is not a replacement for your mouse driver, but an
  extension to it.  Therefore your mouse driver must be loaded before you
  load HGXMOUSE.  Normal mouse functions will work when the HGXMOUSE driver
  is loaded; the extended functions are not active until the driver is 
  initialized.

  TSR Command-line options:

    The HGXMOUSE.EXE TSR supports several command-line options.

   /h, /? : Shows the available command line options.
       /d : Detects and prints the Svga chipset, without installing the TSR.
       /u : Uninstalls the TSR from memory.
       /n : Disables the hardware cursor support.

=============================================================================

 Using the HGXMOUSE programming interface.

 Using the HGXMOUSE interface is transparent if using one of my BGI drivers;
all you have to do is call the mouse reset (interrupt 33, ax = 0) and show
mouse cursor (int 33, ax = 1), just like you would normally.  This allows
HGXMOUSE to work with standard mouse libraries without performing any
additional initialization.  If you are not using the BGI drivers; you
must first initialize the TSR with hgxInit (int 33, ax = 0x4500), then
you may call the standard mouse (int 33) functions.

			      Appendix A

		  Application Programming Interface

    HGXMOUSE provides extentions to the int 0x33 mouse programming API
for initialization and de-initialization, cursor control and version
information.

    A.1 ............................................ hgxInit
    A.2 ............................................ hgxDeinit
    A.3 ............................................ hgxBank
    A.4 ............................................ hgxVersion
    A.5 ............................................ hgxCursorFg
    A.6 ............................................ hgxCursorBg
    A.7 ............................................ hgxSetSacmap
    A.8 ............................................ hgxSetBmpCursor

=============================================================================

1) hgxInit: Enables the enhanced cursor drawing capabilities.

  hgxInit initializes HGXMOUSE with the current mode information.  This
function must be called before any of the enhanced cursor drawing features
can be used.  If you are using HGXMOUSE with my BGI drivers, you do not
need to call this function, since the BGI drivers automatically initialize 
HGXMOUSE during initgraph().

  Modes supported: All

  Input:
	AX = 0x4500
	SI = X resolution of mode (*)
	DI = Y resolution of mode (*)
	DX = Bytes per scanline
	BL = Mode type
	 (0) MODE_P8		8-bit packed  (Mode 0x13 and SuperVGA 256 color)
	 (1) MODE_P15		15-bit packed (SuperVGA 32768 color)
	 (2) MODE_P16		16-bit packed (SuperVGA 65536 color)
	 (3) MODE_P24		24-bit packed (SuperVGA TrueColor)
	 (4) MODE_PL4		4-bit planar  (SuperVGA & TweakedVGA 16 color)
	 (5) MODE_PL8		8-bit planar  (Mode X & other tweaked 256-color)
	 (7) MODE_TWKTEXT	Tweaked text
	 (6) MODE_TEXT		Standard text mode

  Returns:
	AL = 0x45 if successful
	AH = error code (0 if successful)

 (*) Only needed for graphical modes, the text mode cursor determines the
 current resolution from the number of rows and columns currently displayed.

 Example: To initialize the HGXMOUSE TSR for 320x200x256 mode 0x13

	int hgxInit() {
	  union REGS regs;

	  regs.x.ax = 0x4500;
	  regs.x.si = 320;	// X resolution
	  regs.x.di = 200;	// Y resolution
	  regs.h.bl = 0;	// MODE_P8
	  regs.x.dx = 320;	// Bytes per line
	  int86(0x33, &regs, &regs);
	  return ((regs.h.al == 0x45) ? 1 : 0);
	};

=============================================================================

2) hgxDeInit: Disables the extended cursor drawing capabilities.

  hgxDeInit is the opposite of hgxInit.  It disables the enhanced features
of the HGXMOUSE driver and returns the mouse operation to normal mode.
Any call to hgxInit must be matched with a call to hgxDeInit.  Again, if
you are using my BGI drivers with HGXMOUSE, they will automatically disable
HGXMOUSE when closegraph() is called.

  Modes supported: All

  Input:
	AX = 0x4501

  Output:
	AL = 0x45 if successful
	AH = error code (0 if successful)

 Example: To de-initialize the extended functions

	int hgxDeinit() {
	  union REGS regs;

	  regs.x.ax = 0x4501;
	  int86(0x33, &regs, &regs);
	  return ((regs.h.al == 0x45) ? 1 : 0);
	};

=============================================================================

3) hgxBank: Sets the current SVGA bank for HGXMOUSE.

  hgxBank sets the current SuperVGA drawing bank.  Current SuperVGA cards
have 1MB to 4MB onboard, but only 64KB can be accessed at one time.  A paging
scheme is used to access the entire video memory in 64KB chunks.  If you
are setting the bank directly, HGXMOUSE needs to keep updated with the
current bank so that when it draws the cursor on the screen, it properly
restores the current bank the application is using.  If you are using my
BGI drivers, they automatically update the HGXMOUSE bank.

  Modes supported: All

  Input:
	AX = 0x4504
	DL = bank number

  Output:
	AL = 0x45 if successful
	AH = error code (0 if successful)

=============================================================================

4) hgxVersion: Get version of HGXMOUSE

  hgxVersion returns the current version of the HGXMOUSE driver.

  Modes supported: All

  Input:
	AX = 0x4504

  Output:
	BH = Major version
	BL = Minor version
	CX = Code segment of TSR

  Example: To get the curent version of HGXMOUSE

	int hgxVersion(int *major, int *minor) {
	  union REGS regs;

	  regs.x.ax = 0x4504;
	  int86(0x33, &regs, &regs);
	  if (major) *major = bh;
	  if (minor) *minor = bl;
	  return ((regs.h.al == 0x45) ? 1 : 0);
	};

=============================================================================

5) hgxCursorFG: Sets the cursor's current foreground color.

  hgxCursorFG allows you to set the current RGB foreground color of the cursor.
The foreground color is the color that normally displays as white in the
standard mouse cursor.

  Modes supported: MODE_P8, MODE_P15, MODE_P16, MODE_P24, MODE_PL8
  		   (MODE_PL4 - 16 colors, currently not supported)

  Input:
	AX = 0x4505
	BL = Blue value for TrueColor & HiColor modes
	   = Color index (0-255) for 256 color modes
	   = Color index (0-15) for 16 color modes
	BH = Green value for HiColor & TrueColor modes
	   = N/A for 16 & 256-color modes
	CL = Red value for HiColor & TrueColor modes
	   = N/A for 16 & 256-color modes

  Output:
	AL = 0x45 if successful
	AH = error code (0 if successful)

Note: Some hardware cursors can accept 24-bit color values in 16 & 256
	color modes.

  Example: Set the cursor FG color

	int hgxSetCursorFG(int r, int g, int b) {
	  union REGS regs;

	  regs.x.ax = 0x4505;
	  regs.h.bl = b;
	  regs.h.bh = g;
	  regs.h.cl = r;
	  int86(0x33, &regs, &regs);
	  return ((regs.h.al == 0x45) ? 1 : 0);
	};

=============================================================================

6) hgxCursorBG: Sets the cursor's background color

  hgxCursorBG allows you to set the current RGB background color of the cursor.
The background color is the color that normally displays as black in the
standard mouse cursor.

  Modes supported: MODE_P8, MODE_P15, MODE_P16, MODE_P24, MODE_PL8
  		   (MODE_PL4 - 16 colors, currently not supported)

  Input:
	AX = 0x4506
	BL = Blue value for TrueColor & HiColor modes
	   = Color index (0-255) for 256 color modes
	   = Color index (0-15) for 16 color modes
	BH = Green value for HiColor & TrueColor modes
	   = N/A for 16 & 256-color modes
	CL = Red value for HiColor & TrueColor modes
	   = N/A for 16 & 256-color modes

  Output:
	AL = 0x45 if successful
	AH = error code (0 if successful)

Note: Some hardware cursors can accept 24-bit color values in 16 & 256
	color modes.

  Example: Set the cursor BG color

	int hgxSetCursorBG(int r, int g, int b) {
	  union REGS regs;

	  regs.x.ax = 0x4506;
	  regs.h.bl = b;
	  regs.h.bh = g;
	  regs.h.cl = r;
	  int86(0x33, &regs, &regs);
	  return ((regs.h.al == 0x45) ? 1 : 0);
	};

=============================================================================

7) hgxSetSacmap: Sets the sacrifice character map for the text mode cursor.

  The text mode cursor works by copying the character definitions of the
  characters under the cursor into a set of 'sacrifice' characters, then
  drawing the bitmap of the cursor 'on top' of the bitmap in the sacrifice
  characters.  This is why parts of the mouse cursor may appear on other
  parts of the screen; those characters are part of the sacrifice map.
  The sacrifice map can occupy up to 9 characters (3x3 grid) for a 16x16
  cursor.

  In 25-line mode, the sacrifice characters should be taken from the range
  0xC0-0xDF so that the 9th column will be duplicated, otherwise you may
  see vertical lines running through the cursor as you move it around the
  screen.

  Modes supported: MODE_TEXT

  Input:
	AX = 0x4507
	ES:BX = segment:offset of sacrifice character map (9 bytes)
	  Layout of sacrifice map
	  +---+---+---+
	  | 0 | 1 | 2 |
	  +---+---+---+
	  | 3 | 4 | 5 |
	  +---+---+---+
	  | 6 | 7 | 8 |
	  +---+---+---+

  Example: Set the current sacrifice character map

	int hgxSetSacmap(char sacChars[9]) {
	  union REGS regs;
	  struct SREGS sregs;

	  regs.x.ax = 0x4507;
	  regs.x.bx = FP_OFF(sacChars);
	  sregs.es  = FP_SEG(sacChars);
	  int86x(0x33,&regs,&regs,&sregs);
	  return ((regs.h.al == 0x45) ? 1 : 0);
	};

=============================================================================

8) hgxBmpCursor: Sets bitmap data for the cursor pointer.

  hgxBmpCursor allows you to take any bitmap and use it as the mouse pointer.
  The bitmap may contain pixels of any color, along with a special transparent
  color.  Pixels of the transparent color will not be displayed when the
  bitmap cursor is drawn to the screen.

  The format of the bitmap is mode-dependent, but it is the same format used
  for each of my BGI drivers.

  Modes supported: MODE_P8, MODE_P15, MODE_P16, MODE_P24, MODE_PL8
  		   (MODE_PL4 - 16 colors, currently not supported)

  Input:
	AX=0x4508
	BX=Horizontal hot spot of cursor
	CX=Vertical hot spot of cursor
	ES:DX = segment:offset of cursor data
	  Format of cursor data
	    offset	length
	    DX+0 	4 bytes		Transparent color

	    Format of transparent color: (x = don't care)
		00000000RRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGBBBBBBBB - 24 bit modes
		xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxRRRRRGGGGGGBBBBB - 16 bit modes
		xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx0RRRRRGGGGGBBBBB - 15 bit modes
		xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxIIIIIIII - Color index for 256 colors

	;; Following format is the same as the buffer used in getimage/putimage
	    DX+4	2 bytes		Width-1
	    DX+6	2 bytes		Height-1
	    DX+8	n bytes		image data

	    Format of image data:
		24 bit modes:      Each pixel is 4 bytes
		16 & 15-bit modes: Each pixel is 2 bytes
		256-color:         Each pixel is 1 byte
