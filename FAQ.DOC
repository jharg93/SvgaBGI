  Q: Why doesn't the mouse cursor show up when I try to display it?

  A: Most mouse drivers don't recognize video modes other than standard
     VGA, so they don't know how to display the cursor in those modes.
     Some newer mouse drivers, such as Microsoft's and Logitech's,
     have an overlay which knows how to draw the cursor in VESA modes.
     However, there are no current mouse drivers that have support for 
     tweaked modes or other non-VESA video modes.

  Fix:
     The HGXMOUSE TSR/LIB will handle cursor drawing automatically in all 
     the modes the BGI drivers support, so if you load it before your 
     program starts, the mouse cursor will be visible.

  Q: Why isn't anything showing up on the screen when I start drawing
     after initgraph?

  A: The BGI kernel by default sets the initial color to the max color
     supported.  In 16 color modes, this is fine, since the max color
     also happens to be white.  In 256 color modes, the max color is 
     255, which in the default palette is black.  You must do a setcolor(15)
     before drawing.  In the hi/true color modes, the setrgbpalette 
     interface must be used to set the current colors, so initialize
     the current color to white using RealDrawColor.

  Q: Why can't I link the BGI driver into my program?

  A: register{far}bgidriver() may function differently depending on which 
     version and language Borland compiler you have.  The easiest way to 
     get the drivers to link properly is to fool the BGI kernel into thinking 
     that the BGI driver is one of the Borland-supplied drivers.  Every BGI 
     file has an ID string near offset hex 8A in the BGI header.  If this 
     string is changed to EGAVGA before the driver is linked in, then 
     register{far}bgidriver and initgraph will work successfully.  This
     ID string is a Pascal string, with the length field before it, so don't
     forget to modify this byte too.

  Example:
   c:\svga> debug svga256.bgi
   -d180 l 20
   0D74:0180  A0 00 00 00 5C 22 02 00-01 00 07 53 56 47 41 32   ....\".....SVGA2

   -a18a
   { Note: For the protected mode driver, the offset is 18E }
   0D74:018A db 6,'EGAVGA',0

  Q: Why do I get an 'invalid device driver file' when I run my program?

  A: You are probably using Turbo/Borland Pascal 7.0 in protected mode
     with a BGI v2.0 file.  TC++/BC++ and TP/BP in real mode need a
     BGI version 2.0 file.  In protected mode, BP/TP 7.0 need a BGI
     version 3.0 file.  BGI v2.0 and BGIv3.0 drivers are not compatible
     with each other.  The normal v2.0 drivers are located in the main
     source directory, the protected mode drivers are in the BGI30 directory.

  Q: Why doesn't imagesize return the correct value?

  A: The imagesize() function doesn't call the BGI drivers to calculate the
     size of an image.  It also won't return a value >64k.  The correct
     size calculation for the different drivers is:

	Svga16,Twk16    : imsize = 4+(((long)xwid >> 1)+1)*ywid;
	Svga256,Twk256  : imsize = 4+((long)xwid)*ywid;
	Svga32k/Svga64k : imsize = 4+((long)xwid << 1)*ywid;
 	SvgaTC          : imsize = 4+((long)xwid << 2)*ywid;

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Q: Why does initgraph return error 246?

  A: The BGI driver returns an 8-bit signed value to the BGI kernel.  The
     BGI kernel zero extends this value, instead of sign extending it, so
     the value it is returning is actually 246 instead of -10, which is
     grModeNotSup (mode not supported).  This means that your video card
     does not support that particular mode.  If no extended modes work
     on your card, either your card is not supported or it is not getting
     detected properly.
